# CI/CD Basics

A presentation on the basics of CI/CD. 

## Prerequisites

- [Terminal Basics](https://kieranwood.ca/terminal-basics); The basics of using the terminal/command line and some basic commands
- An understanding of [YAML Syntax](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html#yaml-basics); This is what the bulk of the presentation will use

## Optional prerequisites

- [Basics of HTML/CSS/JS](https://kieranwood.ca/basic-web-technologies/#slide=1); Just to understand what we're actually deploying, don't need a strong understanding
- [Basics of static site generators](https://kieranwood.ca/static-site-generators/#slide=1); (recommended but optional. Talked about as an example in the slides but it's not a hard requirement)
